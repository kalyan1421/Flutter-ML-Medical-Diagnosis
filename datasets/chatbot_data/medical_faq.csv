question,answer
What is pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing."
What are the symptoms of pneumonia?,"Common symptoms include cough with phlegm, fever, sweating and shaking chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms can range from mild to severe."
How is pneumonia diagnosed?,"Pneumonia is diagnosed through physical examination, chest X-ray, blood tests, sputum test, pulse oximetry, and sometimes CT scan or bronchoscopy for severe cases."
How to prevent pneumonia?,"Get vaccinated (pneumococcal and flu vaccines), practice good hygiene by washing hands frequently, do not smoke, maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and exercise, and avoid close contact with sick people."
Is pneumonia contagious?,"Yes, pneumonia can be contagious. The germs that cause pneumonia can spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, or close contact. Bacterial and viral pneumonia are contagious."
What causes pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The most common bacterial cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral causes include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19."
How long does pneumonia last?,"With proper treatment, most people start to improve within 1-2 weeks. Complete recovery may take 4-6 weeks or longer depending on age, overall health, and severity of infection."
What is the treatment for pneumonia?,"Treatment depends on the type and severity. Bacterial pneumonia requires antibiotics. Viral pneumonia may need antiviral medications. General care includes rest, fluids, fever reducers, and cough medicine. Severe cases may require hospitalization."
Can pneumonia be cured?,"Yes, most cases of pneumonia can be cured with proper treatment. Early diagnosis and appropriate medication are important. However, pneumonia can be serious, especially for elderly, young children, and people with weakened immune systems."
What is bacterial pneumonia?,"Bacterial pneumonia is caused by bacteria, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae. It can develop on its own or after a viral infection. It typically requires antibiotic treatment and can be more severe than viral pneumonia."
What is viral pneumonia?,"Viral pneumonia is caused by viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or coronaviruses. It is usually milder than bacterial pneumonia but can still be serious. Antibiotics do not work for viral pneumonia."
What is walking pneumonia?,Walking pneumonia is a mild form of pneumonia where symptoms are not severe enough to require bed rest or hospitalization. People can usually continue their daily activities. It is typically caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria.
What is aspiration pneumonia?,"Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit, or saliva into your lungs. This can happen when swallowing mechanisms are impaired, often in people with neurological conditions or after strokes."
Who is at risk for pneumonia?,"People at higher risk include adults over 65, children under 2, people with chronic diseases (asthma, COPD, heart disease, diabetes), weakened immune systems, smokers, and those who are hospitalized."
Can children get pneumonia?,"Yes, children can get pneumonia. It is one of the leading causes of illness and death in children worldwide. Children under 2 years and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk. Vaccination helps prevent it."
What is a brain tumor?,A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. Tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). They can originate in the brain (primary) or spread from other parts of the body (metastatic).
What are the symptoms of brain tumor?,"Symptoms include persistent headaches, seizures, vision problems, hearing loss, balance difficulties, nausea and vomiting, personality or behavior changes, cognitive difficulties, speech problems, and progressive weakness or numbness in limbs."
What causes brain tumors?,"Most brain tumors have no known cause. Risk factors include exposure to ionizing radiation, family history of brain tumors, and certain genetic conditions like neurofibromatosis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome."
How are brain tumors diagnosed?,"Diagnosis involves neurological examination, MRI scan (most common), CT scan, PET scan, cerebral angiography, and biopsy to determine the exact type and grade of tumor."
What are types of brain tumors?,"Main types include gliomas (astrocytomas, glioblastomas, oligodendrogliomas), meningiomas, pituitary tumors, schwannomas, medulloblastomas, and craniopharyngiomas. They are classified by cell type and whether they are benign or malignant."
Is brain tumor curable?,"Some brain tumors are curable, especially benign tumors and some low-grade malignant tumors. Treatment outcome depends on tumor type, size, location, grade, and how early it is detected. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy."
What is glioma?,"Glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or spine. Types include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and glioblastomas. Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type."
What is meningioma?,"Meningioma is a tumor that forms in the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas are benign and slow-growing. They are more common in women and older adults."
What is pituitary tumor?,"Pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain that controls hormone production. Most are benign adenomas. They can cause hormonal imbalances."
How to prevent brain tumors?,"There is no proven way to prevent brain tumors. You can reduce risk by avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, maintaining overall health, protecting against head injuries, and getting regular medical checkups."
What is an MRI scan?,"MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) uses powerful magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues inside the body. It is excellent for imaging the brain, spinal cord, and soft tissues."
What is a CT scan?,"CT (Computed Tomography) scan combines multiple X-ray images taken from different angles to create cross-sectional images of bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues. It is faster than MRI and good for detecting bleeding."
What is a chest X-ray?,"A chest X-ray is an imaging test that uses small amounts of radiation to produce pictures of the organs and structures inside the chest, including lungs, heart, airways, blood vessels, and bones."
When should I see a doctor for cough?,"See a doctor if your cough lasts more than 3 weeks, you cough up blood or discolored mucus, have high fever (above 102°F), difficulty breathing, chest pain, unexplained weight loss, or if you are at high risk for complications."
What are complications of pneumonia?,"Complications include bacteremia (bacteria in bloodstream), lung abscess, pleural effusion (fluid around lungs), empyema (pus in pleural space), respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. These can be life-threatening."
